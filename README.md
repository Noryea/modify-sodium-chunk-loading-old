# Unofficial Sodium Culling Patch
A mod stealing the latest codes from [Sodium's dev branch](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/tree/dev). These codes can reduce the amount of chunks loaded by Sodium and improve the fps significantly, so they deserve to be backported as a patch and made to be compatible with iris, indium, sodium-extra, etc.

Note: The optimization provided by this mod will be included in 0.5.1 in the future(mc1.20.2). Hence the mod is already archieved and will no longer update.

# Tested with:
- sodium
- iris shader
- indium
- sodium extra
- more culling

If you already got an ideal performance improvement with Sodium 0.5.0, this mod will further increase the framerate; if you found that the performance of Sodium 0.5.0 is worse than that of 0.4.x in some cases, then this mod is expected to fix it (not guaranteed).
